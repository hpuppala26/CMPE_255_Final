# Music Recommendation System using the Million Song Dataset

## Overview

This project leverages the Million Song Dataset (MSD) and the Taste Profile subset to develop an advanced music recommendation system. By utilizing various machine learning algorithms and integrating song metadata, we aim to provide personalized music recommendations. This repository contains the code, datasets, and resources used for the project.

## Installation
Clone the repository
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Dataset
The Million Song Dataset (MSD) and the Taste Profile subset are used in this project. The data includes user-song interactions, metadata, and song lyrics. Please ensure you have the necessary permissions to use these datasets for academic purposes.

## Baseline Models
Singular Value Decomposition and a neural network
Neural Collaborative Filtering
Hybrid AutoEncoder Model

## Conclusion
This project successfully developed a sophisticated music recommendation system using the Million Song Dataset. The hybrid SVD and neural network model achieved the best performance, demonstrating the potential of combining classical and modern machine learning techniques.
